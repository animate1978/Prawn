<usage>Mix returns x*(1-a)+y*a, that is, it performs a linear blend between values A and B. The types of A and B must be identical, but may be any of float, point, vector, normal, or color. The variants that operate on colors or point-like objects operate on a component by component basis (e.g: separately for x, y, and z).</usage>
