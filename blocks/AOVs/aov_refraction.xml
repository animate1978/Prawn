	<usage>Passes the values connected to the input, to the refraction AOV. The preset AOVs are aov_surfacecolor, aov_ambient, aov_diffuse, aov_indirectdiffuse, aov_specular, aov_specularcolor, aov_reflection, aov_refraction, aov_rimlighting, aov_scattering, aov_translucence, aov_shadows, aov_occlusion, aov_caustics. Note that all shading models blocks already have assigned AOVs to their respective components, as well as some other blocks, see the blocks information for details.</usage>
