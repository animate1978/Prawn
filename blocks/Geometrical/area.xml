<usage>Returns the geometric mean of the change of &quot;P&quot; between adjacent samples in each parametric direction. It can be interpreted as the area of the microfacet if the parameter being passed is the surface point &quot;P&quot;. The &quot;strategy&quot; variable can be either &quot;shading&quot;, in which case the micropolygon area is calculated with the surface derivatives, or &quot;dicing&quot;, in which case the micropolygons area will be calculated using their geometry. If unspecified, it defaults to &quot;shading&quot;.</usage>
