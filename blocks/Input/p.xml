	<usage>Note that in all shading contexts, &quot;P&quot; is the surface position, the only exception being volume shaders, in which &quot;P&quot; is the light ray origin. Also note that in imager shaders, &quot;P&quot; is the position of the pixel center in raster space, with the z coordinate being 0.</usage>
