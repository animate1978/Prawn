	<usage>Surface derivative of point &quot;P&quot; along direction &quot;V&quot;. This only accesses the global variable &quot;dPdv&quot;. If you want to calculate the surface derivative of other points, use the &quot;Dv&quot; block, which calls Dv(input), or the &quot;Deriv&quot; block, which calculates the derivatives of its first argument in regard to its second argument.</usage>
