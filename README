Prawn is a Visual Shader Creation Tool based off the source of Shrimp 2.
Prawn is a specialized version that uses the RSL Lib, to conform with
Blender text editor limitations. Prawn is also intended to be used with
RIBMosaic and takes advantage of the AOV conventions between Prawn,
RIBMosaic, Blender, Aqsis and OpenEXR, as defined in the "Widow"
pipeline.

Special thanks to Mario Marengo, for all the information in his odforce.net
threads (particularly the glass and hair threads), and for allowing us to use
some of his work.
 Special thanks also to Tal Lancaster (from The RenderMan Repository,
http://www.renderman.org ), for allowing us to use his work and the work he
gathered over the years, at The RenderMan Repository, from authors such as
 Larry Gritz, Stephen H. Westin, Rudy Cortez, Peter Stuart, just to name a few.

Special thanks go also to Rudy Cortez, his work at The RenderMan Academy was
an eye-opener and provided me with a great introduction to RSL.
To sum it up, special thanks to all the people that made available their RSL
code, giving everyone else the chance to learn with it. Without it, Shrimp would
still exist, but its creative possibilities would be much more limited.

Many thanks also to the Aqsis and Pixie developers, for their work in making
sure everyone can have access to free (as in beer and as in freedom) RenderMan
implementations, and particularly special thanks to Romain Behar, for managing
to survive the never-ending succession of very long emails.

And last, but not least, thanks to the 3Delight team, for providing a free
first license to their commercial RenderMan implementation, 3Delight.

If you think you should be here, contact us, and we'll gladly add you to the list ;)

Note: I left all copyright notices of the relevant RSL code/code snippets in place,
in the headers where such functions were declared, and also mentioning the RSL
code authorship in the <usage></usage> tags of Shrimp's XML blocks, when the
relevent code wasn't included in a header, but defined in the XML block itself.

We tried to the best of our possibilities to check the usage policies/licenses
of any RSL code, but some RSL code was devoid of any information, regarding
authorship, and/or license. We have the utmost respect for everyone's work, and 
we have no interest at all, in claiming as our own, the authorship of the work
someone else did, nor to disrespect the license terms under which the respective
work was released. So if you think that the authorship of some RSL code belongs
to you, and it's not credited as such, or that we're using your work without
permission, or respecting your work's license terms, please contact us as soon
as possible, so that we can correct the situation by adding the authorship
information missing, or remove the relevant code, whatever might suit your
 interests the best.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Final note: Every existing RSL code/headers was tweaked/changed in one way or
another, from existing code, to better fit Shrimp's structure and needs, and
in some cases, to add extra funcionality, while in other cases, RSL code was
written from scratch, _but_ i'm no RSL expert by any means, so, any bugfixes &
corrections regarding the RSL headers and RSL code in the XML blocks, are more
than welcome.
